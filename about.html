<p class="centertext">Isles of Hope International is a Christian non-profit organization designed to help mostly poor women in countries around the world. The organization will provide support in the areas of:

    Financial assistance (micro-loans) to start or expand a small business to help with the practical needs of women and their families
    <br>
    Spiritual teaching and training of all women we come in contact with
    <br>
    We will do our best to equip women to start small businesses to help financially supplement the ministries in the country, so as not to be entirely dependent on constant support from this organization.
    Isles of Hope International will work to establish Elizabeth Houses, which are places where women can come to be ministered to, conduct Bible studies, and train for skills such as sewing or other business-related activities. These will also be places where micro-loans can be granted after an established business plan is submitted and reviewed. Church services can also be held here. An Elizabeth House is a safe place for women to come to, open their hearts, and not be judged; a place where they will see and feel the love of Christ and be empowered to become disciples so they can go out and make positive changes in their communities and throughout the country.
    We will work with indigenous Christian women to administer and oversee the Elizabeth Houses. These women are more knowledgeable of their country, culture, and language than foreigners are. We seek and look for women in these leadership roles who have biblical knowledge and counseling experience, as there are many women who come to the houses that have been traumatized by abuse, abandonment, and human trafficking.
    First and foremost, this is the Lordâ€™s ministry, not ours as a board. We only wish to do His will, following the commands of Scripture to help the needy and carry out the Great Commission.</p>
