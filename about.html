                                        <p><strong> As a nonprofit Christian organization, we try to live out and do what the Bible says. We are sinners, certainly not perfect, and can make mistakes. We use 1 Corinthians 10:33 as a guide for what we try to accomplish.<br><br>

                                        In the first part of the verse, where it says “I try to please everyone in everything I do”, we additionally look at Galatians 6:9-10 that says, “Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.” Therefore, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to everyone, especially those in the household of faith.<br><br>
                                    
                                        The middle part of the verse says “not seeking my own advantage”. As a nonprofit, we do not earn any proceeds for ourselves, put others first, and pray we will effect incomes for those in the world who are most in need. Our desire is that many of our brothers and sisters in Christ will be strengthened, spread the Gospel, and effect the lost to be saved. This is executing the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20.<br><br>
                                    
                                        By granting micro-loans, starting Elizabeth Houses, and more, our ultimate goal is to have those we minister to come to know Christ and advance His Kingdom, giving Him, the Triune God, all the praise and glory.

                            <p class="text-start"><strong>Isles of Hope International</strong> is a Christian non-profit organization designed to help mostly poor women in countries around the world. The organization will provide support in the areas of:<br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="fs-5">Financial assistance (micro-loans) to start or expand a small business to help with the practical needs of women and their families</li>
                                <li class="fs-5">Spiritual teaching and training of all women we come in contact with</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            We will do our best to equip women to start small businesses to help financially supplement the ministries in the country, so as not to be entirely dependent on constant support from this organization.<br><br>
                            Isles of Hope International will work to establish Elizabeth Houses, which are places where women can come to be ministered to, conduct Bible studies, and train for skills such as sewing or other business-related activities. These will also be places where micro-loans can be granted after an established business plan is submitted and reviewed. Church services can also be held here. <br><br>An Elizabeth House is a safe place for women to come to, open their hearts, and not be judged; a place where they will see and feel the love of Christ and be empowered to become disciples so they can go out and make positive changes in their communities and throughout the country.
                            We will work with indigenous Christian women to administer and oversee the Elizabeth Houses. <br><br>These women are more knowledgeable of their country, culture, and language than foreigners are. We seek and look for women in these leadership roles who have biblical knowledge and counseling experience, as there are many women who come to the houses that have been traumatized by abuse, abandonment, and human trafficking.
                            First and foremost, this is the Lord&#39s ministry, not ours as a board. We only wish to do His will, following the commands of Scripture to help the needy and carry out the Great Commission.</p>
